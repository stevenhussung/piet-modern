# piet-modern
Quick projects to be interpreted by the npiet interpreter. Exploring piet invariants and writing quick scripts to allow for easier editing, alternate color schemes

# To do
I would like to be able to edit in a text/csv editor using 1A - 6C for the 6 shades and colors, plus W and B for white and black.
This will be converted to the npiet format, .ppm using python. 

Combined with a color palette file .json using key-value pairs to decode each letter, can convert to a .ppm with a more modern color scheme.
